Participants enjoy stimulating cognitive and physical programs, morning coffee and lunch in a supportive environment among peers. Caregivers receive respite and support. We have multiple locations for our Kensington Clubs throughout Montgomery County.

Kensington Club is specially designed to serve older adults with diagnosed early stage dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Since 2008, we have been serving people who:

Can enjoy the company of others with minimal risk of wandering,
Take medication independently or with verbal supervision only,
Are able to eat and use the bathroom without assistance,
Ambulate independently or with a cane.
The Club is an outlet for those with early memory loss who desire opportunities to challenge their mind and try new interests, who want to be pro-active and do something about their memory loss, and who can benefit from being around others in a stimulating and positive environment.

Through social interaction, mental challenges and physical activity, the Club seeks to maintain an intimacy and friendship that set it apart from other social day programs. Each member is treated as an individual and a sense of belonging to the Club is evident. Members find common ground and make friends. They recognize that Kensington Club caters to their individual interests and personalities in an atmosphere of warmth and acceptance."
